## Hi there, I'm Gauravv üëã

### Thanks for stopping by! Here's a bit about me...

I'm an enthusiastic Data Scientist and lifelong learner, fascinated by how data and technology can solve real-world problems. My journey began at the University of Mumbai, where I built a strong foundation in Computer Science and discovered my passion for programming with Java and Python.

I recently completed my Master's in Information Systems at Northeastern University, Toronto (Sep 2023 ‚Äì May 2025). This experience fueled my curiosity about the intersection of data, AI, and business. I love experimenting with new tools, collaborating on innovative projects, and exploring how data-driven insights can make a difference. If you're working on something exciting or want to chat about data, tech, or AI, I'd love to connect!
